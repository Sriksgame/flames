 Project: FLAMES Game (Funny Love Calculator ðŸ˜†)
 Author : [Your Name]
 Date   : [Date]

 Description:
 This is a fun little project based on the popular 
 childhood game "FLAMES". 

 FLAMES stands for:
   F - Friends
   L - Love
   A - Affection
   M - Marriage
   E - Enemy
   S - Siblings

 The game takes two names as input and counts the 
 number of uncommon letters. Based on this count, 
 it eliminates letters from the word "FLAMES" 
 until only one remains. That result is displayed 
 as the relationship prediction between the two 
 people!

 NOTE: This program is just for fun and has no 
 real scientific basis ðŸ˜‚
